## Introduction
There are few things in the world more human than music. Cats can recognize faces, crows can use tools, dolphins can comunicate using a complex language and rats have the ability to perform casual rasoning. But none of them can make music.
Although it is not really knwon when music started, it is clear that it is a human "feature" and therefore something very interesting to model in a machine, not only because it makes machines more humans but also because by learning how to train a compuyter to do such human tasks we learn more about ourselves.
