*Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* Let's talk about that...

## Introduction
My son's favourite animal is the sheep, he loves to bleat when he sees one. It doesn't matter if it is in a book, a video, a plastic figure or in real life.
He knows how a sheep looks like and although I have disscussed about this kind of topics [before](https://garcia-nacho.github.io/FaceRecognition/), I would like to bring this topic up again because I think that the human brain is just amazing. With just one year a human brain has all the neuronal circuits that allows it to learn to reconize patterns no matter how different they are, indeed it is very different to see a sheep in the fields compared with a more or less accurated drawn of a sheep in a book. 
But not only that, a human brain has stored an idea of how a sheep looks like and it can extract that information to draw a sheep
