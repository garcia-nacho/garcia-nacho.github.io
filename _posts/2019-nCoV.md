## Introduction
December the 31st, the Chinese health authorities informed about a case of pneumonia of unknown origin. January the 3rd, another 43 cases were reported to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/). Twelve days later, the Chinese government had found that the cases of pneumonia were all caused by a new type of [coronavirus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/index.html) and traced back the origin of the disease to a with a seafood market in [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan).
One month later Wuhan is under lockdown, 170 persons have died, there are 7818 confirmed cases plus 12167 suspected cases, the virus has reached 17 more countries.

In this post, I am going to explain how to use numerical simulations to study and predict outbreaks like this one.

## The infection.
So far the amount of known information about the virus is very limited but there are some facts that seem to be clear:  

**1st.** The causal agent is a new coronavirus named *2019-nCoV*: Coronaviruses are viruses that in most of cases infect the respiratory system of mammals and birds. The symptoms range from a common cold to pneumonia or death. Since the 2019-nCoV has never been identified it is very likely that the natural reservoir of *2019-nCoV* is non-human and it has just gained the ability to infect humans as a consequence of mutations in its genetic material.  

**2nd.** During these 30 days, the virus has propagated following an exponential progression.  

![progression](/images/cov_progress.png)

**3rd.** The basic reproductive rate (R0) of *2019-nCoV* seems to be something between 2 and 4. This parameter is the mean of new infections caused by an infected patient. As a reference, the R0 of measles is around 15, of AIDS 4, and of ebola 1.5. As you will see later it is possible to decompose this parameter to understand better an infection.

## The first approach to model the infection. 
Looking at the data, the first thing that probably comes to your mind is that it seems that it would be possible to fit the progression of the disease to a simple exponential function like this one:

$$\[y=1+a·e^{b·x}\]$$

and in R we can use the function <code>nls</code> to fit a non-linear function in order to find <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>; unfortunately, <code>nls</code> needs a first approximation of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and we might not have a clue of where to start looking. 

If that is the case, we can make a first guess of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> is to transform our non-linear function into a linear function that can be easily approximated. To do that we need to take logarithms on both sides of the equation to end up with the following equation:

$$\[log(y-1)=log(a)+bx\]$$

Now we can find <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, since the intercept of the line in the y axis will be <code>log(a)</code> and the slope of the line will be <code>b</code>.
And this is how we can do this in R:
{: style="text-align: justify"}

{% highlight r %}
linear<-lm(log(df$Infected-1)~df$Day)
start <- list(a=exp(coef(linear)[1]), b=coef(linear)[2])
{% endhighlight %}

Now that we have a first approximation of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, we use them as starting point to estimate the coeficients of the exponential fit:

{% highlight r %}
mod <- nls(Infected ~ a*(exp(b*Day)), data = df, start = start)
{% endhighlight %}

We can extract the coefficients and make predictions. In this case, we will try to make an estimation of the number of infected people on day 31:

{% highlight r %}
a<-summary(mod)$coefficients[1,1]
b<-summary(mod)$coefficients[2,1]

Day<-31
prediction <- a*(exp(b*Day))
{% endhighlight %}

The model predicts that on the 31st of January there will be 11437 cases. However, the daily report of the WHO says that there are *only* 9826 cases (the green point in the graph). 
![modelexp1](/images/modelexp1.png)

Okey we have missed that one. Let's put that number into the equation and let's try to predict number of cases on day 32. The model says: 13996. However, the WHO says that there are 11953 infections (the blue point of the graph). 

![modelexp2](/images/modelexp2.png)

Again it seems that our model is overestimating the number of cases and although we are still in the uncertainty range (the standard error for the parameter a is almost half of its value: a = 0.72012;  standard error of a = 0.33024), it is very likely that our exponential model will deviate more and more from the reality. In this case I feel very relieved creating a innacurate model, because the model predicts that by the end of April the entire human population would be infected.
{: style="text-align: justify"}

The main reason for this simple model to fail is just that it does not have into account most of the factors that have an impact on the progression of the disease. It can't predict how the disease would expand outside China, how it would progress in case of massive vaccinations, it doesn't' account for human other interventions such as quarantines, lockdowns or prevention measures, it doesn't even take into account the number of deaths. 
{: style="text-align: justify"}

## Numerical simulations vs functions
So far we have created the most basic model, a model that takes into account just one parameter (time); however, as I have mentioned few lines above, modeling infections requires introducing a lot of parameters into the equations (e.g. natural immunity, population density, number of deaths, etc); unfortunately, creating such multivariate functions can be so complex that in most of the cases it not even possible from a practical point of view. 
{: style="text-align: justify"}

Moreover, numerical simulations are extremely powerful, we can add new constraints, parameters or elements, with a couple of lines code. They are so powerful that we could even simulate a virus spreading to a new country based on the traveling rates or what would happen if a vaccine is found and we start vaccinating the population at a certain rate. As a counterpart, the simulations can be slow if we add too many elements or when simulating big populations. 
{: style="text-align: justify"}

Let's see how to create this type of simulations in R. The first thing that we need to do is to create a vector which will represent the population that we want to model:

{% highlight r %}
#Parameters
Total_pop<-10000
df<-rep(1, Total_pop)
{% endhighlight %}

The elements of the vector represent the member of the population and the values of the status of the subjects. In our case we assign 1 to non-infected but susceptible members, 0 are dead subjects, 2 are immune members and values > 3 represent infected members. As you can imagine you can expand this as much as you like just by adding new rules that you can check during the progression of the disease. 
{: style="text-align: justify"}
Now that we have our population, we can infect the patient-zero.

{% highlight r %}
patient_zero<-sample(which(df==1),1)
df[patient_zero]<-3
{% endhighlight %}

So we can start tracking the progression of the disease with a <code>for</code> loop. In this case, I define each iteration as a single day but you can change that to study quicker or slower processes (e.g. 1 iteration/second, 1 iteration/year). 
{: style="text-align: justify"}

{% highlight r %}
for(i in 1:time){
  df[df>=3]<-df[df>=3]+1  
{% endhighlight %}
  
As you can see, the first thing that we do during each iteration (day) is to change the status of the infected by adding 1 to them.
Next, we find out how many people get infected. We compute that using two factors: the number of people in contact with each other and the probability of getting infected if you are contacted by an infected one:
{: style="text-align: justify"}

{% highlight r %}
for (k in 1:length(which(df>=3))) {
    round_contacts<-sample(which(df!=0),contact_rate)
    new_infected<-vector()
    for (l in 1:length(round_contacts)) {
      if(runif(1, min = 0, max = 1)<=Infection_rate & df[round_contacts[l]]==1) new_infected<-c(new_infected,round_contacts[l] )
      
    }
    new_infected<-length(new_infected)
    if(new_infected>0){
      
      if(length(which(df==1))<new_infected){
        new_infected<-length(which(df==1))
      }
    
    new_infected<-sample(which(df==1),new_infected)
    df[new_infected]<-3}
  }
 
{% endhighlight %}
  
The advantage of using these parameters is that it is possible to account for quarantines or more sparse areas/countries at the same time that we account for the ability of an infective agent to propagate. In the multivariate functions those parameters are combined in the R0 parameter[](); however, as you can see we don't need it. 
{: style="text-align: justify"}

Next, we compute the number of deceased:

{% highlight r %}
  #Deaths
  infected<-which(df>=3)
  for (j in 1:length(infected)) {
    if(runif(1, min=0, max = 1)< ((1-Survival_rate)/silent_infection)) df[infected[j]]<-0
  }  
{% endhighlight %}

Then, we asume that patients after reaching certain day get cured and that they become immune, in my model this events happen in a deterministic way but they can be computed as probabilities like the infections or deaths.

{% highlight r %}
if(length(which(df>=3+silent_infection))>0) df[which(df>=3+silent_infection)]<-2
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, we save the status of the population as a row in a large matrix(progression[i,]<-df), so we can explore it after the simulation is completed. 

And that's it!! We are done.

We can make this process more complex by adding more constrains or more vectors to represent for instance other countries/cities with other densities/inmune people but the core of the simulation is done, we only need to start playing around and ploting the results.

## Simulations and inferences

The first thing that we need, is to define the parameters that define the 2019-nCoV:
We will simulate the infection for 100 days. The infection rate is 1%, that means that 1% of the people that have an suitable contact with an infected one gets the disease. In my opinion this number is a good approximation considering an airborne transmision. Coronaviruses are heavy viruses when compared with other airbone viruses. The virus die after 2 hours outside the body and it has to enter the body through the nose, mouth or eyes. So it is not very likely that you are going to be infected from someone else easily. Next, we define the survival rate which so far seems to be around 97.7%. Then, we define the number of people that might have a suitable contact with an infected one every day and 40 sounds like a  very reasonable number. Finally, it has been described that the patients can hold the virus for around 9 days without showing any symtom. When we put all those parameters into the model we have that the approximated R0 () is simmilar to the one described(2-4). 

Those parameters are defined here:
{% highlight r %}
#Parameters
time<-100
Infection_rate<-0.01
Survival_rate<-0.9777
contact_rate<-40
silent_infection<-9
{% endhighlight %}

Now we run the simulation and prepare the data in a ggplot friendly way:


{% highlight r %}
df.plot<-expand.grid(c(1:100),c(1:100))
colnames(df.plot)<-c("X","Y")
df.plot$Time<-1
df.plot$Data<-progression[1,]

  for (i in 1:nrow(progression)) {
  dummy<-df.plot
  dummy$Time<-i
  dummy$Data<-progression[i,]
  if(!exists("to.plot")){
    to.plot<-dummy
  }else{
    to.plot<-rbind(to.plot,dummy)
  }
  }
  
{% highlight r %}
to.plot$Data[to.plot$Data>=3]<-3
{% endhighlight %}

### Scenario 1: No human intervention
Under this scenario the virus propagates and the health autorities don't do anything to stop it. 
![scenario1](/images/scenario1.gif)
The virus propagates and at the end almost the entire population gets infected and immune after a while. 


### Scenario 2: Human efforts to contain the virus
Under this scenario the healcare autorities try to stop the infection by isolating the patients, by stopping classes in schools and universities and by locking down cities. These efforts reduce the number of suitable contacts from 40 to 10.
The measurements start after 15 days from the patient zero and we can simulate it by adding this line to the loop:

{% highlight r %}
  if(i>15) contact_rate<-10
{% endhighlight %}

![scenario2](/images/scenario2.gif)
The virus propagates faster at the beggining but the efforts work and the the population gets immune while the infection rate decreases leading to an erradication of the virus.

### Scenario 3. Vaccination of the population
Under this scenario the healthcare autorities develop a vaccine and start vaccinating the population at a rate of 200 / day

![scenario3](/images/scenario3.gif)

In this very unlikely scenario (no matter what Hollywood says, it is impossible to develop and test a vaccine in 15 days), the virus expands quickly and and some point it compites with the healthcare autorities, but since the number of infected patients is too high the immune individuals don't outcompete the virus on the long term.

### Bonus Scenario 4. Prior vaccination
I want to dedicate this scenario to the anti-vaccine movement. 
The researchers develope a vaccine and the goverment decides to vaccinate a population to prevent 

## Conclusions
After all this simmulations it seems that we might be facing scenario 2. So unless the virus mutates. Of course this simmulations are very very basic and there are elements which are not taken into account. Things like possible reservoirs, additional mutations, borders, etc are very relevant to simulate situations like this one. Additionally, we should stablish all parameters as probability functions instead some deterministic ones like recovery date, etc.. With all those things clarified I still think that this is a very powerful tool that can be used to explore different scenarios and to plan and evaluate different actions to stop the contagion.
