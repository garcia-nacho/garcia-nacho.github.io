### Introduction.
Few months ago my wife told me she wanted to do one of those popular genetic tests that look for you ancestors so you can know where they were from or find distant cousins around the world. Despite I advised her against it because of things like this: *[DNA testing signs a $300 million deal with a drug giant](https://nordic.businessinsider.com/dna-testing-delete-your-data-23andme-ancestry-2018-7?r=US&IR=T)*, she insisted so I bought her a kit.
Last week she received the results and she felt dissappointed: just a few percentages relating her genes with some populations. Nothing else.

Whe she told me, I was really curious about those percetages. How are they calculated? What does it mean? There is no clear information about it
