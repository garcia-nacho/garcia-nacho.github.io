### Introduction.
Few months ago my wife told me she wanted to do one of those fancy genetic tests that look for your ancestors so you can know where they were from or find distant cousins around the world. Despite I advised her against it because of things like this: *[DNA testing signs a $300 million deal with a drug giant](https://nordic.businessinsider.com/dna-testing-delete-your-data-23andme-ancestry-2018-7?r=US&IR=T)*, she insisted so I bought her a kit.
Last week she received the results and she felt dissappointed: just a few percentages relating her genes with some populations. I was really curious about how those percentages were calculated and what they really mean so I started analyzing the raw data that MyHeritage provide corresponding to more than 600000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and in this post I explain you how to extract the maximum from them, not only to find the closer populations according to your genes but to find if you have some predisposition to suffer from some disseases or even how to perform a paternity test if you have your kid's data.

### Genetical background.
Let's start with the beggining: *What the hell is a SNP? and why you should care about them.*
We could say that the genome is the blueprint of life and the genes the instructions to build every single living organism meaning that means that different organisms have different blueprints but how different they are? It looks obvious that the more simmilar two organisms are the more similar their genomes will look. If we look at human beings the differences between us are very subtle. Most of the genes are exactly the same among the whole human populations, and the ones that are different, differ only in a tiny proportion. The mininal different between two genes is what we call a SNP and all the SNPs in our genomes are what makes us unique for bad or for good. Unfortunately, the vast majority of human SNPs are unkown, however everyday science describe more and more SNPs, relating them with diseases or phenotipic traits. 
More technically, we could say that a SNP is a position in the genome and that the possition has one reference code and one or more variants which can be linked with a phenotypes. Moreover, we have two copies of every SNP in the genome, one from your father and one from your mother so it is possible to have three combinations:
Reference-Reference
Reference-Variant of Variant-Reference (Which are the same)
Variant-Variant
And the three possible combinations can have different traits increasing the complexity even more.

Moreover, it is possible to track down the geographical origin of your ancestors because of the inherability of SNPs. Your SNPs at some point belonged to people from one or more places and different subpopulations have different probabilities for different probabities for the reference and the variants so using statistics it is possible to find out how likely is that your ancestors came from one place.  

### Statistical background.

There are several statistical ways to analyze a set of SNPs but the bayesian analysis is a very simple but robust wat if doing it. The bayesian analyses rely on the Bayes' theorem: 

 $$P(A|B) = {P(B|A)· P(A) \over P(B)}$$
 
 Where 
 
 P(A|B) is the conditional probability of A occurring given the fact B 
 i.e: The probability of being European if you have certain SNP
 
 P(B|A) is the conditional probability of B occurring given the fact A
 i.e. The probability of having certain SNP among the european population
 
 p(B) is the probability of B occurring
 i.e. The probability of being European
 
 p(A) is the probability of A occurring
 i.e The probability of havin certain SNP
 
But in this case we don't have only one SNP, we have more than 600000 so it is possible to combine them to have a stronger prediction, lets see how the Bayes' theorem works for multiple events (i.e. SNPs)

 $$P(A|B \bigcap C) = {P(B \bigcap C|A)· P(A) \over P(B \bigcap C)}$$

However there are a couple of problems, we dont know the firs element of the numerator and the denominator so we need to precalculate them. When two events are not ligated: 

 $$P {P(B \bigcap C|A) =  P(B|A)·P(C|A)}$$

and both P(B|A) and P(C|A) are known. Regarding the ligation of SNPs, we have to consider that the SNPs very close in the genome are ligated, meaning that they are if you inherit one is very likely that you inherit others from your the same progrenitor, howevere we have a lot of SNPs, many more than we need so this is not going to be a problem. 

Calculating the denominator is a bit more complicated, however we know that:

 $$P(A|B \bigcap C) = {P(B \bigcap C|A)· P(A) \over P(B \bigcap C)}$$
 
 $$P(\sim A|B \bigcap C) = {P(B \bigcap C| \sim A)· P(\sim A) \over P(B \bigcap C)}$$
 
Where $$P(\sim A|B \bigcap C)$$ is the probability of not occurring A when B and C are occurring since both probabilities are complementary:  

$$P(A|B \bigcap C) + P(\sim A|B \bigcap C) = 1}$$

We can calculate the denominator:


The whole equation looks like this

and this is the general formula:
