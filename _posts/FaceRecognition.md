For millions of years human evolution has selected and improved the ability to recognize faces. Yes, we humans are very good recognizing faces. During the courses of our lives we remember around 5000 faces that we can recall despiste poor ilumination conditions, major changes such as strong facial expressions, the presence of a beards, glasses, hats, etc...
