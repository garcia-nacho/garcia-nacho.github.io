### Introduction.
When it comes to answering one of the most relevant questions that humanity has still open, we need to admit that we don't have a clue and this question is: **"Are we alone in the universe?"**.   
The first historical references to the question are found in ancient Greece. Greek and Roman philosophers reasoned that since the universe seemed to be so vast it would be reasonable to think that other "tribes" would be living somewhere out there. Later on, religious thinking displaced the logical thinking, and humanity was special just because it was God's will to be special. And it was not until the Renascent when others started to ask the same question. If the Earth is no the center of the universe and there are other planets and stars, why should be life on Earth special?   

If you think for a second on the implications that answering that question have, you will realize how crucial it is for us, humans, to answer that question. It doesn't really matter the direction of the answer brecause just knowing with 100% certainty that there is or there is not life somewhere else in the universe would change us as a whole. 

Unfortunately, neither ancient greeks or guys like Copernicus or Huygens had the technology to find it out and indeed we still don't know if we can answer that question today, but today in this post, I will show you some approaches to try to answer that question.

### The paradox of Drake equation
In 1961 Frank Drake, tried to shreed some light into it by defining 

{% highlight r %}
linear<-lm(log(df$Infected-1)~df$Day)
start <- list(a=exp(coef(linear)[1]), b=coef(linear)[2])
{% endhighlight %}
