### Introduction.
For millions of years, evolution has selected and improved the human ability to recognize faces. 
Yes! We, humans, are one of the few mammals able to recognize faces, and we are very good at it. During the courses of our lives, we remember around 5000 faces that we can later recall despite poor illumination conditions, major changes such as strong facial expressions, the presence of beards, glasses, hats, etc... 
The ability to recognize a face is one of those *hard-encoded* capabilities of our brains.  Nobody taught you how to recognize a face, it is something that you just can do without knowing how.
