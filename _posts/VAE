### Introduction.
Of all machine-learning models I personally find autoencoders (AE) really fascinating. AE are a special type of unsupervised
models formed by two sub-models an *encoder* and a *decoder*, between the encoder and the decoder there is an internal layer
which is usully the layer with fewer dimentions of the model and after training will contain a *latent space* for the input.
Encoder and decoder have an inverted shape and the *latent space* is the axis of symmetry of the model.

Alternatively to the typical supervised models, AE are not trained to generate a depdendent variable, they 
are trained so the origingal data is regenerated after going through the model. This special way of training the model gives the autoenconders their most relevant characteristic: AE encode the data into the a small *latent space*. Due to this capability AE can be used to reduce dimensionality of the data, to fiter out noise of the data, to find outlyers and what I think is more interesting to generate new data throught the so called variationl autoencoders (VAE).

VAE can learn the hidden characteristics of any given data and use that knowledge (stored in the latent space) to generate novel inedit data. For example, we can train a VAE with thousands of pictures of human faces and the model will generate novel pictures of faces by sampling the *latent space* learned from the training data sending it through the decoder sub-model.

### VAE and music generation.
There are many posts and literature about VAE generating faces, hand-written numbers or pictures of cats; however, the use of VAE to generate music is less common in the literature. I am personally interested in VAE generating music becase it is a good way to
